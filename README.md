How It Works (Brief)

Analyzes 7 inputs:
	1.	Time spent alone  
	2. Stage fear  
	3. Social events/month
	4.	Going outside/week 
	5. Drained after socializing
	6.	Friends circle size  
	7. Social post frequency

Algorithm (simplified):
	Normalize features to 0–1
	Apply weighted scoring
	Compute probability‑style confidence

Quick Start
	1.	Open web-app/index.html in a browser.
	2.	Fill the form → Analyze My Personality.
	3.	View result & confidence.
 Deploy (GitHub Pages)
	1.	Push project to GitHub.
	2.	Settings → Pages
	         Source: Deploy from a branch
	         Branch: main (or default)  Folder: / (or /web-app)
	3.	App URL: https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/

Customize

Edit gradients in the <style> section of index.html:

/* Main */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #89f7fe 0%, #66a6ff 100%);
/* Extrovert */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #4facfe 0%, #00f2fe 100%);
/* Introvert */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fa709a 0%, #fee140 100%);


Testing

Try these examples:
	Extrovert: Alone 2h , No stage fear , 8 events/mo , Outside 5/wk , Not drained , 20 friends , 5 posts/wk
	Introvert: Alone 6h , Stage fear , 2 events/mo , Outside 2/wk , Drained , 5 friends , 1 post/wk

Tech
	HTML5 for structure
	CSS3 for styling/animations
	JavaScript for scoring & UI

Privacy
	No data storage or tracking
	100% client‑side

Support (Basics)
	If GitHub Pages doesn’t load: check Settings → Pages folder/branch
	If results seem off: model is simplified for demo/education
	Check browser console for errors
